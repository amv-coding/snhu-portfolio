                I almost about to graduate with my B.S in Information Technology, 
         however back in  2018 I graduated with my Associates of Science In Information Technology from NVCC.
         It's really an awesome feeling it's incredible from being  in-and-out-of school, and in-and-out-of rehab I never though tthat I ould have ever thought that I would get to this point. 
         Retarded thugs like me aren't supposed to be in this position, but I have proved so many people wrong including myself. Mor eimportantly I have proved the right people right the people who have always believed in me, and for that I feel awesome, this maybe a tad over-sharing but the article<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2014/06/03/what-to-do-when-you-need-a-bio-rather-than-a-resume/?sh=57b28fd04e43">what-to-do-when-need-a-bio-rather-than-a-resume</a>, so I just did what the article told me to do!
